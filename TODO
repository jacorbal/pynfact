TODO LIST
=========

Code
----

  * Specify dependencies in `setup.py`

  * In `struri.py`:
    * Apply `re.sub` to all members of the list

  * In `builder.py`:
    * Remove redundant code using a universal method for gathering posts
    * Check RSS generation, and do it without changing locale
    * Modularize: classes within classes?

  * In `mulang.py`:
    * Retrieve metainfo without regenerating all HTML from Markdown

  * In *all* of the above and the rest:
    * Use a much more *pythonic* code


Templates
---------

  * `base.html.j2` should not have there those four Jinja2 lines since
    that's the file the user will be dealing with.

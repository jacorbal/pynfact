Why this name?
--------------

Granted it will be used on the "web", the word "log" in Latin may be
translated as *INdicem FACTorum*, hence *InFact* or **'nFact** to be
more easily pronounceable when prepending the prefix *py-*.

Also, *pyblog*, *pyblic*, *pyweblog* and many other cool names were
taken either in GitHub or Google Code.


Notes
-----

This project is in development, so there are some bugs that need to be
fixed and it needs to be deployed as a package.

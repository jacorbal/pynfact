Information
-----------

PynFact is an static weblog generator with a goal of simplicity and just
the needed features.  This project was born out of necessity, to
generate an static web site in a very minimalistic way, and with only
the options that are required in order to accomplish that task.

Why this name?
--------------

Granted it will be used on the "web", the word "log" in Latin may be
translated as *INdicem FACTorum*, hence *InFact* or *-nFact* to be more
easily pronounceable when prepending the prefix `py-`, an indicator of
the programming language where it has been developed.
In essence, *PynFact* is saying: "In fact, a blog out of Python."

Also, `pyblog`, `pyblic`, `pyweblog` and many other cool names were
already taken.

Contributing
------------

PynFact performs a small task and, therefore, there are no aspirations
of being a huge project, but that doesn't mean that it's not going to be
developed in an active way.  Contributors are very much appreciated and
always welcome.

If you find a bug (there are currently lots, since this is a early stage
version), feel free to report it using the GitHub [issue tracker for
this project][bugs].

Check the `TODO.md` list to see if some of your suggestions are already
there, or bring that suggestion to my attention.

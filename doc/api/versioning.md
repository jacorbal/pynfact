Versioning
==========

This project uses the [Semantic Versioning Specification 2.0.0][semver],
(_X_._Y_._Z_) where:

  * _X_ is the _major_ version;
  * _Y_ is the _minor_ version; and
  * _Z_ is the _patch_ version, or _micro_ version.

The version increment goes as:

  * _X_ or _major_, when there are incompatible API changes;
  * _Y_ or _minor_ version new functionality is added in a backwards
    compatible manner; and
  * _Z_ or _patch_ version when there are backwards compatible bug
    fixes.

In the case of pre-releases, it's appended a suffix, that for
compatibility with Python version control, it's separated by a dot when
needed.  Examples of this versions are:

  * `2.0.1.dev_N_`: Developing version _N_
  * `2.0.1a_N_`: Alpha version _N_
  * `2.0.1b_N_`: Beta version _N_
  * `2.0.1rc_N_`: Release candidate _N_
  * `2.0.1`: Stable version
  * `2.0.1.post_N_`: Post release version _N_

Versioning
==========

This project uses the [Semantic Versioning Specification 2.0.0][semver],
(*X.Y.Z*) where:

  * *X* is the *major* version;
  * *Y* is the *minor* version; and
  * *Z* is the *patch* version, or *micro* version.

The version increment goes as:

  * *X* or *major*, when there are incompatible API changes;
  * *Y* or *minor* version new functionality is added in a backwards
    compatible manner; and
  * *Z* or *patch* version when there are backwards compatible bug
    fixes.

In the case of pre-releases, it's appended a suffix, that for
compatibility with Python version control, it's separated by a dot when
needed.  Examples of this versions are:

  * `2.0.1.dev*N*`: Developing version *N*
  * `2.0.1a*N*`: Alpha version *N*
  * `2.0.1b*N*`: Beta version *N*
  * `2.0.1rc*N*`: Release candidate *N*
  * `2.0.1`: Stable release
  * `2.0.1.post*N*`: Post release version *N*
